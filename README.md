# Chess-Tournament-Tool
This program takes a group of players and matches them by skill, keeping track of their games.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

I wrote this program my second year of AP Computer Science, senior year of high school. I was an International Baccaleaureate student, and a part of the program involved working with someone to create a program that could help them. My AP Calculus teacher also runs the chess club and asked me if I could make him a tool that would help him to manage tournaments.

The tool is relatively straightforward. You just need the Tournament.jar file and the chessinfo.txt file in the same directory. The chessinfo.txt file can be edited either outside or inside the program to add or remove player names from the tournament. Once the program is started, no more edits can be made to the player list.
